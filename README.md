This is a program that allows one to send mass personalized emails to a csv mailing list. Originally created for survey distribution, this program was made with a few specific functions in mind:
- mass sending personalized emails
- sending them all from a more "professional" alias email
- sending emails to a singular organization with multiple email addresses
- reading from a csv with a variable amount of emails per row
- forwarding each email to PI so she can keep track of it
